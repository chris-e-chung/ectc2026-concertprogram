                        <p><em>A note from the composer, Ian Cleworth:</em></p>
                        <p>I first arrived in Tokyo on Japan’s National Culture Day in late 1981 and immediately made my
                            way
                            to Yoyogi Park. There, wide-eyed with wonder, I encountered demonstrations of culturally
                            significant arts such as Judo, Odori (traditional dance), and Yabusame – a spectacular
                            exhibition of
                            horseback archery. However, having not yet heard taiko performed live – my only experience
                            of it at
                            that point being through LPs – you can imagine my excitement when, from some distance, the
                            immense boom of Meiji Shrine’s Ōdaiko (grand drum) reached my ears. I ran as fast as I could
                            in the
                            hope of witnessing this imposing instrument being struck with such force, only to miss it by
                            seconds.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Years later, I did eventually see the Ōdaiko played by one of the shrine priests, but the
                            visceral
                            impact of that first, distant encounter remains unmatched, and the power of its resonance
                            continues to reverberate within me to this day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Emperor Meiji’s taiko resounds far and wide, and I felt this was an appropriate aural image
                            to draw
                            upon when composing Pearl for Taikoz’s sister ensemble, Synergy Percussion, on the occasion
                            of
                            their 30th anniversary in 2004. Taikoz grew out of Synergy’s early explorations into taiko
                            territory,
                            and the resonance of those first concerts continues to be felt today.
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the title? Well, what gift does one give for a 30th anniversary? Pearls, of course!
